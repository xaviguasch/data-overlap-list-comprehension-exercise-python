## List Comprehension 3

ðŸ’ª This exercise is HARD

# Instructions

Take a look inside **file1.txt** and **file2.txt**. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.

You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files. 

e.g. if file1.txt contained:

```
1
```

```
2
```

```
3
```

and file2.txt contained:

```
2
```

```
3
```

```
4
```

```
result = [2, 3]
```

**IMPORTANT**: The result should be a list that contains **Integers**, not **Strings**. Try to use **List Comprehension** instead of a **Loop**.

# Example Output

```
[3, 6, 5, 33, 12, 7, 42, 13]
```
